done
- style forms
- redirect host to hostpage 
- change up navbar view as a host


favs
--create an AddFavorites component?

--in hotel.js?
const [favorites, setFavorites] = useState([])

const AddFavoriteHotels = (hotel) => {
    const newFavoriteList = [...favorites, hotels]
    setFavorites(newFavoriteList)
}

in the return:
inside ?
<HotelList ?(or whatever Hotel is) >
handleFavoritesClick={AddFavoriteHotels}
favoriteComponent={AddFavorites}

--in HotelList
include <FavoriteComponent>

in the backend:
make many:many relationship for hotels, .populate

user will have a field of hotel and fav hotel ref Hotel

to query hotels through users, put field in the hotel 

await user.findbyid.populate(own hotels, favorite hotels)


1. examine data we are getting from hotel( id, etc)
2. what you wanna put to the embedded favs to user
3. fav button -> get info from hotel when i check own
4. query users
